# DataQuest - Data Analyst in Python 

Repository for my guided projects from DataQuest's "[Data Analyst in Python](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/)" online course. 

## Guided Project I: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

For free mobile device applications, such as those offered by the App Store and Google Play, the main source of revenue comes from in-app advertising. The amount of users downloading and using the app is therefore important, since more users means more potential revenue.

The project uses the two different data sets to perform an analysis that will help us better understand which apps are likely to attract more users.

## Guided Project II: Analysis of Hacker News Posts

Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories receives comments or up-votes. 

This project looks at a sample of the Hacker News [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) to perform an analysis of which types of post receive more comments on average, and if there's a certain time of day where you are more likely to receive comments for your post.
