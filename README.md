# DataQuest - Guided Project I
First guided project for DataQuest's Data Analyst in Python course. 

## Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

For free mobile device applications, such as those offered by the App Store and Google Play, the main source of revenue comes from in-app advertising. The amount of users downloading and using the app is therefore important, since more users means more potential revenue.

The project uses the two different data sets to perform an analysis that will help us better understand which apps are likely to attract more users.
